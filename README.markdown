# Sentiment Analysis App (Automotive Topics)

This repository contains a sentiment analysis application that classifies text related to automotive topics (e.g., car reviews, forum discussions) into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The project uses **Multinomial Logistic Regression** as the core machine learning model, implemented in Python, to analyze automotive-themed datasets.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Predicts sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for automotive-related text inputs.
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression**: Trained model for accurate multi-class sentiment prediction.
- **Automotive Focus**: Tailored for analyzing car reviews, customer feedback, or automotive forum posts.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF).

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (Multinomial Logistic Regression)
- **Data Processing**: pandas, NumPy
- **NLP Tools**: NLTK (or spaCy, depending on implementation)
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt`

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of automotive-related text, such as car reviews or forum discussions, labeled with sentiments (positive, negative, neutral). The data is preprocessed to remove noise, apply tokenization, and convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

*Note*: The dataset is assumed to be included in the `data/` folder or sourced externally. Update the README with the specific dataset source if applicable.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FingersArts/Sentiment_App.git
   cd Sentiment_App
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   If the project includes a script for predictions or a simple interface:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   *Note*: Replace `main.py` with the actual script name if different.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Input Text**:
   Provide automotive-related text, such as:
   ```
   This car has excellent fuel efficiency and a smooth ride!
   ```
   or
   ```
   The engine performance is disappointing for the price.
   ```

2. **Run Sentiment Analysis**:
   - If using a command-line script, input text via the script or a provided interface.
   - If a web app (e.g., Streamlit or Flask), launch the app and enter text in the UI.

3. **View Results**:
   The model outputs:
   - **Sentiment**: Positive, Negative, or Neutral
   - **Confidence Score**: Probability distribution across classes

**Example**:
- **Input**: "This car has excellent fuel efficiency and a smooth ride!"
- **Output**:
  - Sentiment: **Positive**
  - Confidence: 0.92 (Positive), 0.05 (Neutral), 0.03 (Negative)
